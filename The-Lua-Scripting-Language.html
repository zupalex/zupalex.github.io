<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
<p>The best introduction to Lua is of course <a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html">the one written by the authors themselves</a>.</p>

<p>In a Nutshell, Lua is a <i>scripting language</i> which means that it is not a language by itself. It works as an additional layer to another program. 
This allows to be able to modify the properties and functionalities of the program without having to recompile the source code.<br/>
It is also <i>dynamic</i> which means that you can modify it while the program is running. Everything happens in modules which can be added or removed extremely easily, encouraging experimentation.</p>

<p>The following sub-sections are explaining the basic concepts of the Lua scripting language. Anyone slightly experienced with other programming language should get confortable with it easily.</p>

<h2 id="var-and-types">Variables and types</h2>

<p>Unlike a language like C, Lua variables do not *need* to be declared nor typed. For instance in C you would need to write the following to assign 3 variables to respectively integer, 
string of character and floating point number</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
int i = 5;
string s = "This is a string";
float f = 3.14157;
</pre>

<p>In Lua you would write directly</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
i = 5
s = "This is a string"
f = 3.14157
</pre>

<p>The types are deduced from the assigned value. They are also not definitive. You could reassigned the variable i later on to something else with a different type. 
Note that you also do not need anything at the end of a line to terminate it. You can though use a semi-colon to separate different statements on the same line</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
i = 5; s = "This is a string"; f = 3.14157
</pre>

<p>There are 8 basic types in Lua: <i>nil</i>, <i>boolean</i>, <i>number</i>, <i>string</i>, <i>function</i>, <i>userdata</i>, <i>thread</i>, and <i>table</i></p>

<h3 id="var-nil">nil</h3>
<p>Have only one value which is... <b>nil</b><br/>
It means the absence of any useful value. It is used to reset a variable, to kind of "delete" it from the environment.</p>

<h3 id="var-bool-num-str">boolean, number ans string</h3>
<p>They are the same than their C counterpart types.<br/>
<i>boolean</i> are either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>.<br/>
<i>number</i> are either integer or floating point, without distinction.  <br/>  
<i>string</i> are chain of characters of variable length terminated by '<b>\0</b>' or the <b>NULL</b> character.<br/>
<i>string</i> can be concatenated together using the operator "<b>..</b>"</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   print("Hello".." World".." !!")
</pre>

<p>would print on screen "Hello World !!".<br/>
Please note that if you need to sequentially concatenate strings this might not be very efficient. For instance it is not recommended to do the following</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   local s = "Hello"
   s = s.." World"
   s = s.." !!"
</pre>

<p>In this case you are copying the value of the string s several times while it is unnecessary. This won't be an issue with short strings but may become one if performances 
are important while dealing with long strings. If you need to sequentially append strings at the end of another string you should look into 
the <a href="#"><i>table.concat</i></a> function discussed a bit later.</p>

<h3 id="var-table">table</h3>
<p><i>table</i> are associative arrays.<br/>
They can behave like a standard C array or as maps with an association of a <i>key</i> and a <i>value</i>.<br/>
More about table <a href="#">here</a> and <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="var-func">function</h3>
<p>Self explanatory. Functions are described into more details <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="var-ud">userdata</h3>
<p><i>userdata</i> are used as a link to C pointers. They are particularly useful for example to associate a C++ class to an object that can be manipulated in Lua.<br/>
More about the userdata later.</p>

<h3 id="var-thread">thread</h3>
<p>We don't really care here.</p>

<p><a href="#intro">go back to top</a></p>

<h2 id="the-env">The Environment</h2>

<p>Variables are scoped in Lua as they are in other languages. For instance a C snippet that would be</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
 -- [assuming a boolean x has been set earlier in the code]

int a;                                      // a is declared here

if(x == true)
{
   a = 1;                                   // a is in scope because declared outside and before the if
   string message1 = "a is equal to 1";     // message1 is declared here
   cout << message1 << endl;
}                                           // end of message1 scope
else
{
   a = 2;                                   // a is in scope because declared outside and before the if
   string message2 = "a is equal to 2";     // message2 is declared here
   cout << message2 << endl; 
}                                           // end of message2 scope

                                            // a is still in scope but message1 and message2 are not
</pre>

<p>Writing something similar in Lua using the variable definition described above would not give quite the same result</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
 -- [assuming a boolean x has been set earlier in the code]

a = 0                             -- a is **globally** declared here

if x then
   a = 1                          -- a is in scope because declared **globally** before
   message1 = "a is equal to 1"   --  message1 is **globally** declared here
   print(message1)                          
else
   a = 2                          -- a AND message1 are in scope because declared **globally** before
   message2 = "a is equal to 2"   -- message2 is **globally** declared here
   print(message2) 
end                                          

                                  -- a, message1 and message2 are still in scope because **globally** declared
</pre>

<p>By default, Lua variables will be global meaning that once defined, they are here to stay. If you want to scope them, you have to use the keyword <i>local</i></p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
 -- [assuming a boolean x has been set earlier in the code]

local a = 0                            -- a is locally declared here

if x then
   a = 1                               -- a is in scope because declared outside and before the if statement
   local message1 = "a is equal to 1"  -- message1 is locally declared within the if statement
   print(message1)                          
else                                   -- message1 falls out of scope here
   a = 2                               -- a is in scope because declared outside and before the if statement
   local message2 = "a is equal to 2"  -- message2 is locally declared within the if statement
   print(message2)
end                                    -- message2 falls out of scope here                           

                                       -- a is still in scope because locally declared outside of the if statement
</pre>

<p><a href="#intro">go back to top</a></p>

<h2 id="tables">Tables</h2>
<p>The tables are one of the main tool for any Lua script. They can be used as C arrays or vectors, or as some kind of dynamic structures.</p>

<p>Let's consider the following C statements</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   int array[3];

   array[0] = 3;
   array[1] = 1;
   array[2] = 4;
</pre>

<p>would be</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   local array = {}      -- this "declares" the table
   array[1] = 3
   array[2] = 1
   array[3] = 4
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   local array = { 3, 1, 4 }      -- this "declares" and populates the table
</pre>

<p>Please note that in Lua, arrays starts at index 1 and not 0.</p>

<p>Another way to achieve the say thing and that would give a behavior closer to a C vector would be</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   local array = {}        -- this "declares" the table
   table.insert(array, 3)  -- append 3 at the end of the array, here element number 1
   table.insert(array, 1)  -- append 1 at the end of the array, here element number 2
   table.insert(array, 4)  -- append 4 at the end of the array, here element number 4
</pre>

<p>The function <i>table.insert</i> is behaving similarly to the <i>push_back</i> function with C vectors.<br/>
When tables are populated as arrays or vector, the size can be retrieved using the # operator</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   print(#array)    -- would print 3 because we inserted 3 elements in our table
</pre>

<p>Now a table could be used as a struct.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   struct detector{
      unsigned long long entry = 0;
      double energy = 0;
      int strip = 0;
   };
</pre>

<p>Would be</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   local detector = {
      entry = 0,
      energy = 0,
      strip = 0
   }
</pre>

<p><b>Please note that in this case the operator # would not return the size of the table. There is not easy way to get how many elements are in a table using key-value association.</b></p>

<p>When the table is initialized with elements, these elements are separated with a coma (,).<br/>
As we already said, tables are dynamic, so nothing prevents you to then add members to that structure (something that would not be possible in C.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   detector.timestamp = 0
</pre>

<p>And now your detector structure has a new member called timestamp.</p>

<p>Note that the dot (.) is used as an accessor to table members, similarly to how one would access a struc member in C. But this is just a helper syntax for the actual accessor []</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   detector["timestamp"] = 0    -- this would produce the same result as above
</pre>

<p>Actually tables are really the *base* of Lua since everything is registered in a global table called <b>_G</b><br/>
When a variable is declared globally like explained earlier, what is happening is that this variable is actually registered in that global table.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   var = 3.14157      -- a global number is declared here

   print(var)         -- will print on the screen "3.14157"
   print(_G["var"])   -- will print on the screen... "3.14157", congratulation
</pre>

<p>The way to process through a table is slightly different according to the way it has been filled (as an array or as an key-value struct like object). These ways are discussed in the next sub-section.</p>

<h3>Concatenating strings from a table</h3>

<p>Tables offer another nice functionality: the concatenation of all the strings contained within a table. For this to work, the table needs to be used as a sorted array</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   local str = { "Hello", " ", "World", " !!"}
   print(table.concat(str))    -- will print "Hello World !!"
</pre>

<p><a href="#intro">go back to top</a></p>

<h2 id="ops-and-statements">Operators and Statements</h2>

<p>Statements are quite similar to C statements, just with slightly different syntax.</p>

<h3 id ="the-ops">The operators</h3>

<p>The operators are very similar to the C operators.<br/>
The following list give the correspondence between the C operator (on the left) and the Lua operator (on the right)</p>

<p>And a modulo operator % (integer rest of the euclidean division)</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   14%3 = 2
</pre>

<p><a href="#intro">go back to top</a></p>

<h3 id="if-statement">if statement</h3>
<p>the if statement is written in the following way.</p>

<p>C if statement</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   if(a == b)
   {
      [do something]
   }
</pre>

<p>Lua if statement</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   if a == b then
      [do something]
   end
</pre>

<h3 id="else-statement">elseif, else statments</h3>
<p>the else statements are written the following way</p>

<p>C if-else if-else statement</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   if(a == b)
   {
      [do something]
   }
   else if(a < b)
  {
      [do something else]
  }
  else
  {
      [do something else]
  }
</pre>

<p>Lua if-elseif-else statement</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   if a == b then
      [do something]
   elseif a < b then
      [do something else]
   else
      [do something else]
   end
</pre>

<p>Please note that the <i>elseif</i> statement takes no space between <i>else</i> and <i>if</i>. Also the <i>elseif</i> statement <b>needs</b> a <i>then</i> after the condition while the <i>else</i> <b>does not</b>.</p>

<p><a href="#intro">go back to top</a></p>

<h3 id="for-statement">for statement</h3>
<p>The for statement is very similar as well</p>

<p>C for statement</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   for(int i =0; i <= 9; i++)
   {
      [do something]
   }
</pre>

<p>Lua for statement</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   for i=0,9 do
      [do something]
   end
</pre>

<p>The Lua for statement can take an extra parameter to specify the step</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   for i=1,10,2 do
      [do something]
   end
</pre>

<p>will produce a loop that will use the following values of i: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.<br/>
The next value would be 11 since the step is 2 but since we specified that we want i to be maximally 10, it stops at 9.<br/>
The step could also be negative</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   for i = 100,-50,-15 do
      [some fancy stuffs]
   end
</pre>

<p><a href="#intro">go back to top</a></p>

<h3 id="while-statement">while loop</h3>

<p>The while loop is again very similar</p>

<p>C while</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   bool b = false
   int x, y = 14941, 9642 
   while(!b)
   {
      if(x%y < 5) b = true;
      else x = x-y;
   }
</pre>

<p>Lua while loop</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   local b = false
   local x, y = 14941, 9642
   while not b do
      if x%y < 5 then
         b = true
      else
         x = x-y
      end
   end
</pre>

<p><a href="#intro">go back to top</a></p>

<h2 id="reading-tables">Reading tables</h2>
</p>The content of a table can be read in different ways.</p>

</p>If the table is a simple array/vector, one could do it the C way</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   local tbl = { 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 7 }

   for i = 1 , #tbl do
      print(tbl[i])
   end
</pre>

<p>would print on the screen</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
3
1
4
1
5
7
</pre>

<p>Lua offer another way to do that though</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  local tbl = { 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 7 }

   for i, v in ipairs(tbl) do
      print(v)
   end
</pre>

<p>would print exactly the same thing.<br/>
The <i>ipairs</i> relates to the fact that tables are associative containers with each entry being a key and a value. When tables are used as arrays, the keys are merely the element 
number (in the order they have been inserted in the table).<br/>
We are here considering the pairs of key-value in the table *tbl*, and assign the <i>key</i> to <i>i</i> and the <i>value</i> to <i>ipairs</i>.</p>

<p>Something similar can be done for tables not used as arrays. For instance</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   local detector = {
      entry = 987654,
      energy = 666.666,
      strip = 3,
      timestamp = 14157
   }

   for k, v in pairs(detector) do
      print(k, v)
   end
</pre>

<p>would print</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   entry      987654
   strip      3
   timestamp  14157
   energy     666.666
</pre>

<p>Note that I put a random order for the print out. This is because when the *keys* for a table are not integer of increasing order starting from 1 separated by steps of 1, 
the order in which they are processed is random.<br/>
Note also that this time we are calling *pairs* and not *ipairs*. The keys are not integers anymore.</p>

<p><a href="#intro">go back to top</a></p>

<h2 id="funcs">Functions<h2>
<h3 id="funcs-defs">Function Definition</h3>
<p>Function definitions in Lua are similar to their C siblings but at the same time very different.<br/>
For the similarities:</p>

<p>A function in C</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   int AddNumbers(int a, int b)
   {
      return a+b;
   }
</pre>

<p>The same function in Lua</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   local function AddNumbers(a, b)
      return a+b
   end

   -- an equivalent function definition would be
   local AddNumbers = function(a, b)
      return a+b
   end
</pre>

<p>In the end functions are just like any other more classic variables (numbers, booleans, strings, ...). They can be either <b>global</b> or <b>local</b>, they can be registered in tables, 
their assignment can be changed, ...</p>
 
<p>Functions can be called from within other functions as you would expect:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   local function AddNumbers(a, b)
      return a+b
   end

   local function AddAndSquareResult(a, b)
      local add = AddNumbers(a, b)
      return a^2
   end
</pre>

<h3 id="funcs-override">Function Overriding</h3>
<p>Something very handy is the ability to override an existing function. This is particularly useful for several reasons. Let's imagine we have an existing function doing the addition between 2 numbers, 
included in a module previously loaded. Now we would like this function to add together these numbers only under a specific condition, 
and would like it to be retroactive on all the scripts using it, even the ones called from outside of our scripts.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   -- MODULE A previously loaded

   local function AddNumbers(a, b)
      return a+b
   end

</pre>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   -- Our own Module

   local OriginalAddNumbers = AddNumbers
   -- we assigned to the variable OriginalAddNumbers the current function AddNumbers

   local function AddNumbers(a, b)
      if a > b then
         return OriginalAddNumbers(a, b)
      else
         return nil
      end
   end
</pre>

<p>What the function *AddNumbers* is now doing is calling the old value of this function (merly adding together a and b) only if a is biger than b, and doing nothing otherwise. 
As long as this override happens after the original <i>AddNumbers</i> function is loaded, any call to this function will now call our overridden version, even calls outside of our script(s).</p>

<h3 id="funcs-methods">Function as table members</h3>
<p>As mentioned ealier, function are variables like any other. The can therefore be a member of a table.<br/>
Taking again the example of a table that would be a struct for a stripped detector</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   -- assuming we calibrated our detector and obtained
   -- a slope of 'a' and an offset of 'b' for each of the strips

   local detector = {
      entry = 9173,
      energy = 123.456,
      strip = 3,
      GetEnCal = function(self)
         return a[self.strip] * self.energy + b[self.strip]
      end
   }

   local en3 = detector.GetEnCal(detector)

   [...]

   detector.strip = 2
   detector.energy = 987.654
   local en2 = detector.GetEnCal(detector)

   print(en2)
   print(en3)
</pre>

<p>would print the calibrated energy using first the parameters for the strip 3 then for the strip 2.<br/>
What happens is that the function <i>GetEnCal</i> which is stored in the table <i>detector</i> gets called by <i>detecotr.GetEnCal</i>. The argument passed is the table <i>detector</i> itself, 
so in the function, self is replaced by <i>detector</i>. You can do the rest of the math yourself.<br/>
You will notice it is not a very elegant syntax. Lua has a nice way of dealing with this. The functions calls could be replaced by</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   local en3 = detector:GetEnCal()

   [...]

   detector.strip = 2
   detector.energy = 987.654
   local en2 = detector:GetEnCal()
</pre>

<p>The colon (:) instead of the dot (.) when calling a function is actually implicitly passing what is on the left of the ':' as the first argument of the function without having to specify it. 
It is easy here to follow that the table *detecotr* will then be passed as the first argument in the function <i>GetEnCal</i>.  
This table actually starts to look like a the equivalent of a C++ class with its own methods. There would still be some more job to do to have a class-like behaviors with this table but that's not 
the subject here (but it is the subject of <a href="#">this section</a>).

<h2 id="mods-and-packs">Modules and Packages</h2>

<p>As said previously, Lua revolves around modules and packages. But what are these?<br/>
These are merely scripts that are loaded to provide functions or definitions to the main script or other sub-scripts. You can see them as "#include" for a C/C++ script.<br/>
There are several ways to load modules, the main ones being</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
   -- Assuming we have a module in /home/tdrump/science.lua

   -- Option 1: dofile
   dofile("/home/tdrump/science.lua")

   -- Option 2: require
   require("science")
</pre>

<p>The 2 options are different in what the achieve eventually.<br/>
The <i>dofile</i>  will load the given file no matter where it is as long a a path (absolute or relative) is provided and execute that script, effectively loading whatever is inside. 
If global variables or functions are declared in the loaded script, then from now on they are available to any other scripts running in the same environment 
(as long as you try to use them after the script has been loaded).<br/>
The <i>require</i> is a more demanding beast. You notice that you do not specify here anymore the path to the script. This is because require use what you pass as an argument as a hint 
to find the corresponding script. For it to work you need to have included the path where the script is located in the list of path the *require* function will use to search for it. Also 
a major difference with <i>dofile</i>* is that <i>require</i> register the script you loaded in the global table <i>package</i> and keep track of all the modules you included. This way 
if several sub-modules calls <i>require</i> on the same module, it will effectively be loaded only once. This is not the case with <i>dofile</i>.<br/>
